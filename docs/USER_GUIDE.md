- **Default type** for most audio sources
- **Visualized** in 3D/2D views as colored spheres
- **Full positioning control** with radius, azimuth, zenith
- **Individual rotation** capability (roll, yaw, pitch)

#### Ambisonic Source (Blue)
- **Special recording source** for ambisonic microphones
- **Only one allowed** at a time in the system
- **Controls environmental audio** capture rotation
- **Not visualized** as a positioned source
- **Rotation controls** affect microphone orientation

#### Send Sources (Red)
- **Effects routing** or auxiliary sends
- **Not visualized** in spatial views
- **Volume and mute controls** available
- **Used for reverb, delay,** or other processing

### Source Type Management

1. **Change source type**:
   - Select source with number keys (1-7)
   - Press **M** for Mono/Stereo mode
   - Press **A** for Ambisonic mode (if available)
   - Press **S** for Send mode

2. **Ambisonic mode restrictions**:
   - Only one source can be in Ambisonic mode
   - Switching to Ambisonic mode will reset previous Ambisonic source
   - Ambisonic sources control microphone rotation instead of position

### Rotation Systems

The system has three independent rotation systems:

#### 1. Camera Rotation (View Only)
- **Purpose**: Change viewing angle without affecting audio
- **Controls**: Mouse drag or Roll/Yaw/Pitch sliders
- **Effect**: Rotates your view of the 3D scene
- **Audio impact**: None - purely visual

#### 2. Cube Rotation
- **Purpose**: Rotate the reference frame
- **Controls**: CubeRoll/CubeYaw/CubePitch sliders
- **Effect**: Rotates the boundary cube visualization
- **Audio impact**: Can affect spatial reference

#### 3. Individual Source Rotation
- **Purpose**: Rotate individual sources around their position
- **Controls**: Source-specific roll/yaw/pitch
- **Effect**: Rotates source orientation
- **Audio impact**: Affects source directivity (if supported)

### Head Tracking Integration

When connected to a head tracking system:

1. **Real-time head movement** updates the listener position
2. **OSC messages** control head orientation:
   - `/head/roll` - Head tilt left/right
   - `/head/pitch` - Head nod up/down
   - `/head/yaw` - Head turn left/right

3. **Visual feedback** shows head orientation with colored axes
4. **Independent control** from camera and cube rotations

## Hardware Setup

### MIDI Controller Integration

#### Yamaha 02R96-1 Setup
1. **Physical connection**:
   - Connect MIDI OUT from mixer to computer MIDI IN
   - Use USB-MIDI interface if needed

2. **Software setup**:
   - Run provided simulator if no physical hardware
   - Launch `yamaha_02r96_simulator_gui_v2.py`
   - Create virtual MIDI port "Yamaha 02R96-1"

3. **Configuration**:
   - Select "Yamaha 02R96-1" from MIDI device dropdown
   - Mappings are pre-configured in `data/midi_mapping.json`
   - Test with faders and buttons on mixer

#### Generic MIDI Controller
1. **Identify your controller**:
   - Note the device name as shown in system
   - Determine CC numbers for controls you want to use

2. **Create custom mapping**:
   - Edit `data/midi_mapping.json`
   - Add entries for your controller
   - Map CC numbers to actions like "setTrackVolume"

3. **Test and refine**:
   - Start with basic volume controls
   - Add positioning controls gradually
   - Use message log to debug issues

### OSC Integration

#### External Audio Engine
1. **Network setup**:
   - Ensure computers are on same network
   - Configure IP addresses in code (currently 192.168.1.50)
   - Test network connectivity

2. **OSC configuration**:
   - Audio engine should listen on port 8100
   - Spatial mixer sends on port 8000
   - Verify OSC message formats match

#### Head Tracking System
1. **OSC endpoints**:
   - Head tracker sends to port 9000
   - Configure head tracker IP (currently 127.0.0.1 for local)

2. **Message format**:
   - `/head/roll`, `/head/pitch`, `/head/yaw`
   - Values typically -1 to +1 range
   - System will map to appropriate rotation range

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

3. **Adjust zenith** for height placement
4. **Fine-tune** with small adjustments
5. **Verify position** in both 3D and 2D views

#### Working with Multiple Sources
1. **Position one source at a time** completely
2. **Use source selection** frequently
3. **Monitor VU levels** to ensure sources are active
4. **Solo tracks** to isolate positioning effects
5. **Save/document** positions for recall

### Performance Optimization

#### For Slower Systems
- **Use 2D view mode** primarily
- **Limit simultaneous source movement**
- **Close unnecessary applications**
- **Reduce window size** if needed
- **Disable visual effects** if available

#### For Live Performance
- **Pre-configure source positions**
- **Use MIDI controller** for real-time control
- **Practice transitions** between scenes
- **Have backup positions** ready

### Best Practices

#### Source Management
- **Use descriptive source types** appropriately
- **Keep Ambisonic source** for environmental capture
- **Reserve Send sources** for effects
- **Maintain consistent** volume levels

#### Spatial Design
- **Consider listener perspective** when positioning
- **Use full 3D space** - don't just work in horizontal plane
- **Create realistic** source distances with radius
- **Test positions** from multiple viewpoints

#### System Integration
- **Document OSC message formats** for external systems
- **Back up MIDI mappings** before modification  
- **Test hardware connections** before live use
- **Have contingency plans** for system failures

#### Collaboration
- **Share position coordinates** with team members
- **Document source assignments** and purposes
